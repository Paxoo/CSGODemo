# Analyzing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Data
The `csgo` package provides data parsing capabilities for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO) data. In this repository, you will find the source code and issue tracker pertaining to the `csgo` package.

## Setup
### Requirements
`csgo` requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.6 and [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/) >= 1.13. Python acts as a wrapper for the Go code which parses demofiles.

### Installation
To install `csgo`, clone the repository and install it from source by doing `python setup.py install`.

## Example Code
Using the `csgo` package is straightforward. Just pick a demofile and have a set of Pandas dataframes in seconds. Use the example below to get started.

```python
from csgo.parser import DemoParser

# Create parser object
# Set log=True above if you want to produce a logfile for the parser
demo_parser = DemoParser(demofile = "astralis-vs-liquid-m1-inferno.dem", match_id = "astralis-vs-liquid-m1-inferno.dem")


# Parse the demofile, output results to dictionary with df name as key
data = demo_parser.parse()

# The following keys exist
data["Map"]
data["Rounds"]
data["Damages"]
data["Kills"]
data["Bomb"]
data["Grenades"]
data["EnemiesFlashed"]
data["TeamFlashed"]
data["PlayerInfo"]
data["ItemPickup"]
```

## Examples
Take a look at the following Jupyter notebooks provided in our `examples/` directory.
